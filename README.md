# uniteAllTextFilesInOne
This script unites all the text files in a directory an writes them at just one file, puting a new line for each file added

This script must be placed at the same directory with all files you want to join
and it will generate a new file called 'uniqueFile.txt' (with all the files of the directory inside)

Example:
----------
File1.txt
'Content 1'
----------
File2.txt
'Content 2'
----------
File3.txt
'Content 3'
----------

After run, the script will make a new text file:
----------
uniqueFile.txt
'Content 1
 Content 2
 Content 3'
----------
